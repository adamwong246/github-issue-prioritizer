Some clients get it wrong, and send values such as `image/pjpeg`, `image/x-png`, or `application/octet-stream`.\r\n\r\nWe store the content type of the image both in our database and as metadata on the files we upload to Amazon S3. Once we have the file, we can examine it to determine its actual MIME type rather than relying on unreliable client information, and Paperclip actually does this to prevent some kinds of spoofing. Use the same method Paperclip does to determine what kind of image has been uploaded and set its content type accordingly.\r\n\r\nI did not touch two attachments which appear to be unused: `image` on the Challenge model (there are no challenges with images set in prod), and `attachment` on the Content Entry model (there have been no new content entries since 2012). \r\n\r\nPerformance\r\n---\r\n\r\nProcessing images will be slightly slower as additional work is done.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere should be no change in security related to this pull request. The `file` command is already being executed on the uploaded file, so running it a second time adds no new attack surface.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpload a file using a client which sets the wrong content type, and verify that the entry in the database has the correct content type (and, in QA2, that the file has the correct Content-Type in S3).\r\n\r\nOne known bad client is Internet Explorer 7, which is available on Sauce Labs; you can test with this by logging in to https://qa.hubbubhealth.com/users/sign_in (since the main page is broken in IE7) and setting your avatar. Examine the value of `avatar_content_type` on the user record.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to set the iOS client to upload with a bad content type by [changing the content type](https://github.com/hubbubhealth/hubbub-ios/blob/c43ebb6dd71cbb8afc15c376c01824eb73e0bb43/Source/Shared%20Superclasses/VLCheckInEntryViewController.m#L289) and checking in a prove it photo. Examine the value of `proof_content_type` on the user challenge activity record.\r\n\r\nDeployment\r\n---\r\n\r\nSimply deploy.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIssue #1767 set content type by examining image"

It's part of a larger block of code to streamline device\r\nrelated logic, but I'm submitting this piece too keep the requests small.  \r\n\r\nWe are storing fitbit and nike tokens in the user table.  Moves, Jawbone, and\r\nWithings tokens have their own individual tables.\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a single place to store tokens.  I added 3 tables and related models and tests.\r\n\r\nThe `user_linked_accounts` table stores the user_id and the type of account (fitbit, jawbone, etc).\r\nIt also stores the manufacturer's account id.\r\n\r\nEach `user_linked_account` entry has a related entry in either `oauth1_accounts` or `oauth2_accounts`\r\ndepending on the protocol the manufacturer uses.\r\n\r\nThe UserLinkedAccount model is using single table inheritance so that each entry in the \r\n`user_linked_accounts` table has it's own class like `UserLinkedAccount::Fitbit`.  This way we can \r\nadd methods specific to each api.\r\n\r\nThis can ship as it is without affecting current functionality.  Before it goes live there will\r\nbe a data migration to add the existing tokens to the tables.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\n\r\nNo change\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nNo change\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis adds no functionality, the site should function as normal.

Currently we are using the information provided by the client verbatim by storing it in the database and setting the `Content-Type` on Amazon S3.\r\n\r\nThis turns out to be a problem with dumb clients, like Internet Explorer[[1]](http://stackoverflow.com/a/116059/25637)[[2]](http://struts.1045723.n5.nabble.com/uploaded-image-file-contentType-IE-vs-Firefox-td3477658.html). Various versions have uploaded files as `image/pjpeg` and `image/x-png` instead of their IANA-given designations of `image/jpeg` and `image/png`. Serving images with these content types works poorly when combined with clients who are strict in what they accept, such as the [AFNetworking library](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking).\r\n\r\nWe should ignore the client's idea of the type of the file, examine the actual file, and set the content-type based on that examination.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome data on what we have in production:\r\n\r\n```psql\r\nd9rjd3pkj5riqo=> select proof_content_type, count(*) from user_challenge_activities group by proof_content_type;\r\n    proof_content_type    |  count\r\n--------------------------+---------\r\n                          | 2046874\r\n image/jpeg               |   20757\r\n image/png                |      42\r\n application/octet-stream |     442\r\n image/gif                |       1\r\n(5 rows)\r\n\r\nd9rjd3pkj5riqo=> select avatar_content_type, count(*) from users group by avatar_content_type;\r\n avatar_content_type | count\r\n---------------------+-------\r\n                     | 18595\r\n image/pjpeg         |  2264\r\n image/jpeg          |  5771\r\n image/x-png         |    91\r\n image/gif           |    95\r\n image/png           |   252\r\n(6 rows)\r\n```"
